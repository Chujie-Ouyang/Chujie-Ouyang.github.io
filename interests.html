            <h2>Applications of Spectral Methods in Complex Domains</h2>
            <p>
                My research focuses on applying spectral methods to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) in complex geometric domains. I develop techniques to adapt spectral approximations to irregular boundaries, ensuring high accuracy and computational efficiency. Current work includes optimizing basis functions for non-standard geometries.

            <h2>Low-Regularity Functions</h2>
            <p>
                I study numerical methods for low-regularity functions, which are common in problems with discontinuities or limited smoothness. My work aims to design robust spectral techniques that maintain accuracy, with applications in fields like fluid dynamics and material science.

            <h2>Efficient Numerical Algorithms</h2>
            <p>
                I focus on creating efficient numerical algorithms that balance computational cost and accuracy. This includes optimizing spectral methods for large-scale problems and leveraging parallel computing to enhance performance in high-performance computing environments.
